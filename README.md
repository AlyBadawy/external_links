Open external links in new tab
==============

### Open external links in new tab using JQuery

This is a jQuery plug-in to override the default behavior of all external links and add a `target="_blank"` to them.


#### Requirements:

This plug-in requires that you use jQuery.
So, make sure your web page includes a link to jQuery before including this plug-in.

#### How to use:

In the webpages, where you want to use this plug-in, add links to both jQuery and to `js/com.alybadawy.external_links.js`. make sure that you link to jQuery first.

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="js/com.alybadawy.external_links.js"></script>

then place the `js/com.alybadawy.external_links.js` file in your JavaScript assets folder.
